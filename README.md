# GIG-Coding-Challenge
I was unable to make the data persistent on the client side. I'm familiar with localStorage and sessionStorage but couldn't tie everything together in this particular project. Also was unable to use the country list provivided by the "country-list" module so i added a few countries in the dropdown menu to replace it.
